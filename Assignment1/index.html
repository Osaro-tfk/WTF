    <h1>Animal Farm Book Review</h1>
    <p>Animal Farm written by George Orwell, although using an imagery of man's relationship with animals under his care, paints a picture of societal classes and the anomalies of society. The writer's simplistic writing approach bears so much weight from which we can draw life lessons. It shows how ignorance and nonchallance can jeopardize a proposed common goal.</p>
